\arguments{
\item{data}{a vector of x and y coordinates of data point.}

\item{type_plot}{a character that indicate the type of the plot. On of the following: "hexagonal_heatmap", "scatter_plot", "polygon", "density_contour".}

\item{legend.text}{a character or expression vector of length â‰¥ 1 to appear in the legend.}

\item{legend.title}{a character string or length-one expression giving a title to be placed at the top of the legend.}

\item{axis.text}{a character for both x and y axis texts.}

\item{axis.title}{a character for both x and y axis title.}

\item{plot.title}{a character that represent the title of the plot.}

\item{xlim}{a observations not in this range will be dropped completely and not passed to any other layers. If a NA value is substituted for one of the limits that limit is automatically calculated.}
